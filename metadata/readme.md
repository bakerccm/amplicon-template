# Metadata for SERDP RDX amplicon sequence dataset

- **Original metadata files** [220518_Doherty_16sFWD_220517.txt](/metadata/220518_Doherty_16sFWD_220517.txt) (md5: 00a589316cd38a8767d77a6f3727cbd7) and [220520_Doherty_ITS_Closeout_220518.txt](/metadata/220520_Doherty_ITS_Closeout_220518.txt) (md5: 9186ff34c360f2d2ce451170170d0e4a) were supplied by ANL and Stacey.

 These files contain an error in which the STR_T2_+RDX_-11Y_-COMP samples were incorrectly labelled (R1 appears twice, R4 is missing, and R2/R3 are off by one line). Correct labels were confirmed by Stacey by email (November 29, 2022):

       G9 - STR_T2_+RDX_-11Y_-COMP_R1  
       G10 - STR_T2_+RDX_-11Y_-COMP_R2  
       G11 - STR_T2_+RDX_-11Y_-COMP_R3  
       G12 - STR_T2_+RDX_-11Y_-COMP_R4  

 These files also contain problematic line breaks, extra tabs, and special characters in what appears to be ISO-8859-1 character encoding.

- The **modified metadata files** in the repo [220518_Doherty_16sFWD_220517_MODIFIED.txt](/metadata/220518_Doherty_16sFWD_220517_MODIFIED.txt) (md5: 53e9191c52683d9ee728b8f043aee7aa) and [220520_Doherty_ITS_Closeout_220518_MODIFIED.txt](/metadata/220520_Doherty_ITS_Closeout_220518_MODIFIED.txt) (md5: 4b6cbd9771a0b870704c4a38ac59283f) should contain the correct labelling of the STR_T2_+RDX_-11Y_-COMP samples, and formatting problems should be fixed. The character encoding should now be UTF-8, and invalid characters deleted. These files are generated from the original metadata by the code in [samples_16S.sh](/metadata/samples_16S.sh) and [samples_ITS.sh](/metadata/samples_ITS.sh) respectively.

- The files [samples_16S.tsv](/metadata/samples_16S.tsv) and [samples_ITS.tsv](/metadata/samples_ITS.tsv) are **reformatted versions** of the metadata files for use with snakemake and downstream analysis. They are also generated by the code in [samples_16S.sh](/metadata/samples_16S.sh) and [samples_ITS.sh](/metadata/samples_ITS.sh). The main change is that '+' and '-' characters in sample names are replaced with 'y' and 'n' to avoid problems such as '-' being treated as a field delimiter.
